# Diversity, Inclusion and Openness

## What

This document is intended to set some basic guidelines on the topic of **Diversity, Inclusion and Openness** through questions
for organizers of international conferences which are endorsed and supported by the wider community such as PyCon APAC.

If you are running or plan to run a conference which you intend to be for the international community, it will be a good
idea to go through this document to understand better what the expectations of the wider community to you.

## History

During PyCon APAC 2023 in Tokyo (Oct 26 to Oct 29 2023).
The initial discussion document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14W2OROJ62rPoY-iz4SCIBbfBkWvU27AolN3YypR7Uok/edit?usp=sharing).

## Objective

The objective of this theme is to _increase_ inclusion and _not to_ exclude. This needs to be emphasised so that members
of the community do not take parts of this document as a guide to impose restrictions or increase hurdles for other
members of the community to participate in hosting our regional conference.
