# PyCon APAC 2023 Proposal

## Reasons to hold PyCon APAC in Japan
Each year since 2011 we have held PyCon JP, an international conference for the promotion of the Python programming language. 
In both 2018 and 2019, we had about one thousand attendees, thus becoming the third largest Python conference in the world after PyCon US and EuroPython. Given that track record, we would like to organize PyCon APAC in 2023, creating a space where Python users from Asia and beyond can gather and exchange their knowledge.
