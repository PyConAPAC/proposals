# Considerations concerning COVID-19 for PyCon APAC 2021

Considering the unprecendeted issues presented to conference organizers by the
COVID-19 pandemic, please address the following items in your proposals:

- COVID-19 situation doesn't improve (or have gotten worst) since the proposal was sent
  and international and domestic travel is still restricted

  In this situation, what are your alternative plans? Do you plan to do an
  online conference? Do you plan to cancel the conference? How will you manage your
  alternative plans?

- COVID-19 situation relatively improves and conferences have generally
  been re-started in the host country.

  In this case, how will you prepare for the "new-normal" to ensure the safety
  of your attendees? Will you reduce the number of attendees and execute
  Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)? What SOPs will you be following and from
  what authority? Will you be working alongside a competent authority in your
  country to ensure the safety of your attendees?

- What will be the deciding factor(s) for you to decide on the execution of your
  alternative plans or SOPs and its tentative timeline?

  Please indicate what will be your deciding factors for you to switch to your
  alternative plans and SOPs to protect your attendees and its tentative
  timeline.
