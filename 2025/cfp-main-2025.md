This is the announcement for the Call for Participation (CfP) of PyCon Asia Pacific (APAC) 2025. The purpose of this call is to select an Asia Pacific in-country team willing and able to organize the Python conference in their home country.

## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

The PyCon APAC conference series is presently 'owned' by a group of active volunteers representing PyCon organizers in various Asia Pacific countries. In the past, such organizers were sought to host the PyCon APAC brand of the conference as part of their in-country PyCon. Since the first PyCon APAC in 2010, interest in hosting PyCon APAC has gradually increased, leading to this Call for Participation. It is our hope that different Asia Pacific countries will take turns hosting as the momentum of Python develops in this region.

This Call for Participation is meant to collect proposals from teams wishing to help run PyCon Asia Pacific in 2025 in a location they are based in. PyCon APAC is intended to serve as a platform for Python users throughout Asia-Pacific countries to come together and meet fellow Python users. This is also true for anyone exploring Python.

If you have not done so, please also follow [PyCon APAC on X](https://twitter.com/pyconapac) and on [Mastodon](https://mtd.pythonasia.org/@pyconasia) for more updates on what's happening around the Asia Pacific region concerning PyCon and the Python community in general.

## Timeline for Proposals<a name="timeline"></a>

The CfP will run until the following deadline for submissions. Proposals must be submitted by midnight Anywhere on Earth (AoE UTC-12) on the deadline day and must adhere to the requirements specified in this document. Please read the entire document carefully.

- 1st Sep (Sun) 2024 - CfP announcement and opening of proposals acceptance
- 1st Oct (Tue) 2024 - Deadline for submissions
- 4th Oct (Fri) 2024 - Voting starts for PyCon APAC 2025 host
- 11th Oct (Fri) 2024 - Voting ends
- 27th Oct (Sat) 2024 - We'll announce the host for PyCon APAC 2025 on the final day of PyCon APAC ID 2024

*If we do not receive any comments during the first peer review (1), we will skip the amendments stage (2) and proceed directly to voting and deciding on the host*

## Proposal Workflow<a name="workflow"></a>

1. Send your proposal as a PDF to: [pycon-organizers-apac@googlegroups.com](mailto:pycon-organizers-apac@googlegroups.com) (This group will loosely be referred to as PyCon APAC Comittee or _PAC_)
2. Due to time constraints this year, we will not be implementing a peer feedback review.
3. After the submission deadline, we will vote for the host. To keep the voting manageable and efficient, voting will only be done among the [APAC country representatives](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyConAPAC/Community).
4. The final decision for the selection of the on-site team and location will be announced by the PAC within a week after the voting deadline ends.

## What is PyCon APAC<a name="what"></a>

PyCon APAC is the Python conference for countries in the Asia Pacific and Australasia region, including countries that do not organize their own PyCon conference. Unlike PyCon US and EuroPython, where the number of participants is more stable, the number of participants at PyCon APAC varies depending on the hosting country. The following is an estimate of past PyCon APAC's:

- 350+ participants in PyCon APAC (Singapore, 2012 and 2018)
- 500+ participants in PyCon APAC (Tokyo, Japan, 2013)
- 700+ participants in PyCon APAC (Taipei, Taiwan, 2014 and 2015)
- 1000+ participants in PyCon APAC (Seoul, South Korea, 2016)
- 200+ participants in PyCon APAC (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 2017)
- 500+ participants in [PyCon APAC (Manila, Philippines, 2019)](https://pycon-2019.python.ph)
- 100+ participants in [PyCon APAC online (Bangkok, Thailand, 2021)](https://2021.th.pycon.org)
- 500+ participants in [PyCon APAC online (Taipei, Taiwan 2022)](https://tw.pycon.org/2022/en-us/about)
- 700+ participants [PyCon APAC (Tokyo, Japan 2023)](https://www.pycon.jp/organizer/index.html#pycon-apac-2023)

The main medium of communication in PyCon APAC is also dependent on the hosting country. To meet the needs of an international audience, however, and as host of PyCon APAC, **the use of English (or translation to English) in the main and parallel tracks is a requirement.** PyCon APAC will have:

- At least 2 conference days
- More than 2 parallel tracks, with at least 2 tracks in English

Given the nature of PyCon APAC, we are open to accepting proposals that can only host fewer attendees, with a target of 100 attendees being the minimum.

# On-Site Team Requirements<a name="onsite"></a>

These are the requirements that an on-site team will sign up for when submitting a proposal. Changes to these requirements are possible, but they must be approved by the APAC before implementation.

1. The conference will be financially and legally run by an entity registered in the hosting country and of which the on-site team is part.
2. The on-site team must be geographically located in a country in the Asia Pacific or Australasia region.
3. The on-site team must be willing to actively coordinate with the PAC board and other regional Python groups or Python workgroups where applicable so that all parts of the PyCon APAC ecosystem can work together productively. Of importance is the quality of the presentations, which should be kept relevant, current, and of a good/high level.
   1. This can be assisted with a panel of expert reviewers that ensures the quality of proposals submitted. The feedback of reviewers must be provided to the proposers to assist improvements to their presentations where applicable.
   2. The on-site team is encouraged to invite the participation of PyCon APAC members as part of the panel of expert reviewers.
4. The on-site team must be composed of at least five (5) active members, and the team or a majority of its members must have previously organized at least one (1) PyCon conference before. Five members is the bare minimum for the on-site team to successfully handle the amount of work required to organize the conference.
   1. Please keep in mind that the team is required to grow significantly during the conference days, and it is considered an advantage if the on-site team can show that they already have a good number of volunteers to count on during the conference days.
5. The on-site team should provide details of suggested keynote speakers. At least 2 such speakers should be part of the plan.
6. The on-site team should ideally provide 2 available venue options, together with catering options for the venues. The size of the venue will depend on the size of past PyCon conferences in the host country plus between 10-20% more in view of PyCon APAC.
   1. The venue must provide breakout rooms for the number of expected attendees and the number of parallel tracks, with 2 English-based tracks being the minimum.
   2. Note: In past PyCon APAC's, on-site teams have sought and collaborated with institutions of higher learning (IHL's) as they can provide the venues required at no or low cost.
7. The conference must provide the following services to all attendees. Proposals will have to provide details about how these can be implemented at the proposed venues:
   1. Food and drinks for lunches and breaks on all conference days (and tutorials and sprints where applicable). The on-site team is strongly encouraged to cater to the needs of various dietary restrictions, whether religious or otherwise, and provide relevant information for the participants.
   2. Optionally, breakfast on all conference days (not necessarily on the tutorial and sprint days where applicable).
   3. WLAN service to access the Internet during the conference (and the tutorial and sprints if applicable).
   4. At least one social event, which can be a dinner, a show, or some other form of entertainment, where food and drinks are served. The main social event should ideally be available to all attendees but may also be limited to a lower number of people if the selected venue cannot serve as many participants.
   5. Audio/video facilities to support speakers and talk recordings.
8. The on-site team must provide a local expenses budget plan as part of the proposal. An example budget plan can be provided on request. The on-site team will provide details of how they will fund the conference in support of the expenses expected. As far as possible, conference fees should be kept to a minimum to support the participation of attendees from the Asia Pacific / Australasia region. In support of the potential PyCon APAC host, requests for financial support can be made to the PAC to cover specific items of the budget plan. **The finances associated with the running of the conference must be maintained in a manner that ensures transparency and proper financial governance.**
9. The on-site team must be able to provide supporting letters for visa applicants wanting to attend the conference.

# Proposal Structure<a name="structure"></a>

The proposal must cover all of the following points:

1. A proposal introduction that describes the motivation for the proposal.
2. A description of the on-site team, its members, and its history in the context of their local Python community.
3. Short biography of the key members and their previous experience in conference and events organizations.
4. Previous conference history of the on-site team (if any). Describe which conferences were run and provide some figures on their size (registrations, tracks, total income).
5. Assignment of key positions to on-site team members. Positions to be assigned (one member can be responsible for more than one of the following roles):
   1. Chairperson of the on-site team workgroup: usually also the conference chair and representative of the conference for that year.
   2. Sponsor manager: on-site contact for all sponsor activities, responsible for local sponsors.
   3. Venue manager: handling all contacts with the venue and caterer.
   4. Logistics manager: handling all aspects of local logistics and customs.
   5. Conference desk manager: responsible for the on-site help desk, on-site registrations, tickets, cash refunds, attendee support, etc.
6. List of all team members that will be present during the conference itself as volunteers (but not necessarily help before the conference begins), and/or sources from which people can be or will be acquired if needed (e.g., universities, other local associations, etc.). This list is indicative, as most of the volunteers helping during the conference are usually enrolled during the last months/weeks before the conference.
7. List of potential international and local sponsors. Note: Local sponsors help a lot in funding the conference. These are often smaller companies that will not move to new locations with the conference, so a local contact is highly beneficial in attracting these sponsors.
   1. The PAC can assist with contacts with international sponsors where possible.
8. Proposed dates for PyCon APAC 2025.
9. Keynote speakers proposed.
10. Conference events. Describe what kind of (social) events you can propose for the conference and are able to support.
11. Expected differences from previous PyCon APAC conferences. Please highlight what things would need to be changed in the way the conference is run on-site. Examples of things we would consider worthwhile to mention:
    1. "We can get additional support from the local government/city council."
    2. "We need to provide tickets to city locals at reduced prices."
    3. "We intend to serve meals in a different venue."
    4. "We have some extra space available for posters/sponsors."
    5. "We want to have our local Python conference run as a satellite event," etc.
12. Venue proposal. Describe the following sub-items:
    1. Location, reachability by car, train, plane.
    2. Venue floor plans, catering floor plans (if different from the venue).
    3. Total capacity for talk rooms, training rooms, plenary sessions, booth space, and catering/restaurants; if possible, including room plans.
    4. A/V equipment.
    5. Video recording, availability of on-site support for A/V recordings, possibly even including live- or post-editing.
    6. Lighting equipment, availability of on-site support for lighting.
    7. Upstream internet connection (at least 100MB up and downstream).
    8. WLAN structure, service provider, their experience with similar events (The WLAN has to be able to handle at least the number of participant devices expected without problems).
    9. Available space for conference desk, sponsor booths, posters, social event, etc., planned locations of these on the floor plans.
13. Accommodation. Describe the following sub-items:
    1. Available hotels/hostels near the conference venues, their distance from the conference venue, city center, airport, and train station.
    2. Rates for the hotels/hostels and, optionally, special rates which can be made available to attendees.
    3. The above for three different categories: high end, average, and low end. Optionally, a "main" hotel that serves as the default choice for conference attendees and serves as a social hub.
14. City tourist information. Describe the following sub-items:
    1. General information: touristic information, restaurants, mobility.
    2. Travel information: how to get to the city and to the conference venue.
    3. Travel costs from the previously mentioned travel hubs to the conference venue. This information should indicate how easily the conference city and venue are accessible. It should also answer questions like: Are there convenient ways to get to the conference venue from airports/trains and bus stations without having a car/taxi?
15. Visa. If attendees may require a visa to enter the country/city, please provide detailed information.
16. Proposed local budget.
    1. The budget should include all expected costs for the on-site support, including the venue costs, catering, on-site rental of equipment, costs for venue services and logistics, extras like public transport passes, etc. Optional budget positions should be indicated as such, to give more flexibility in comparing proposals.
    2. The budget must handle different scenarios related to different venues, where applicable, including fixed rooms costs, catering, services, etc. Please provide cost estimates for 200, 400, 600, and 800 attendees (if possible with the venue).
    3. Please write to the PAC if you need help with setting up a budget plan.
17. Code Of Conduct (CoC)
    PyCons are required to have Code Of Conducts (CoC) compatible with [PyCon US's Code Of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/us.pycon.org/code-of-conduct/). Please have a link to your CoC within the proposal.

## APAC Organizers Progress Meetings

Starting for PyCon APAC 2022, we'll have a set amount of PyCon APAC Organizers calls (virtual or otherwise) leading up to the conference day.

These progress meetings are intended to give the host organizing team an opportunity to ask questions, get feedback, and source ideas and help from the PyCon APAC organizers community. It will also be an opportunity for the wider community to get to know the organizers from the host country and check on the progress of the hosts.

The calls will be hosted by the host country or the manager for the PyCon APAC proposals. The times of the calls are:

1. Around 60 days after the announcement of the host country
2. Around 60 days after the first progress meeting
3. 30 days before the first proper conference day

# Proposal Format<a name="format"></a>

Some things to consider when sending the proposal document:

1. Please mark information that you consider confidential in the proposal, so that we can remove those parts from the version that will be published during the Call for Participation process.
2. The proposal itself should be sent as a PDF, LibreOffice, Word document, shared as a Google Docs document, or a markdown file in the GitHub of this repository.
3. When using third-party content (e.g., pictures, graphics, special fonts), please add a section that includes the references for these elements of the proposal. We need to publish the proposals to the general public and thus adhere to copyright restrictions that may apply to the content.

## Samples of Proposals

You can refer to the [proposals we received for PyCon APAC 2021](https://github.com/PyConAPAC/proposals/tree/master/2021/submissions) for some ideas on how a proposal is made.

## PyCon APAC - On the Longer Term<a name="longterm"></a>

A longer-term goal of PyCon APAC is to integrate on-site teams into workgroups within a PyCon APAC framework, wherein tasks that do not need to be done by on-site team members can be implemented by distributed workgroups that can work remotely and persist from location to location. This framework will help:

- Reduce the loss of institutional knowledge
- Reduce the amount of work and financial risk for on-site teams
- Encourage the wider APAC community to take part in the organization process beside the on-site team

The PyCon APAC framework can take reference from models such as [those of EuroPython](https://www.europython-society.org/post/99718376575/europython-workgroups-call-for-volunteers).

## Additional considerations for PyCon APAC 2025<a name="addons"></a>

Below are additional considerations specific to 2025 and are to be included in the proposal. Please include them in a separate section.

- Health And Security Guidelines
  COVID-19 is still with us. Due to the international nature of APAC conferences where we will get many guests coming from different countries, consider having [Health And Security Guidelines](https://us.pycon.org/2024/about/health-safety-guidelines/) so attendees will feel safe while keeping in mind of local laws, regulations and customs.
