This is the announcement for the Call for Participation (CfP) for PyCon Asia Pacific
(APAC) 2022. The purpose of this call is to select an Asia Pacific in-country team
willing and able to organize the Python conference on-site at their country of origin.

## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

The PyCon APAC conference series is presently 'owned' by a group of active
volunteers that represent PyCon organizers in various Asia Pacific countries. In the
past, such organizers were sought to host the PyCon APAC brand of the conference
as part of their in-country PyCon. Since the first PyCon APAC in 2010, interest to host
PyCon APAC has gradually increased, leading to this Call for Participation. It is our
hope that different Asia Pacific countries will take turns to host as the momentum of
Python develops in this region.

This Call for Participation is meant to collect proposals from teams wishing to help run
PyCon Asia Pacific in 2022 in a location they are local to. PyCon APAC is
intended to serve as a platform for Python users throughout Asia-Pacific countries to
come together to meet with fellow Python users. The same can be said for anyone
adopting an exploratory perspective towards Python.

If you have not done so, pease also follow [PyCon APAC Twitter](https://twitter.com/pyconapac) for more
short and quick updates on what's happening happening around the Asia Pacific region concerning PyCon and the Python
community in general.

## Proposal Workflow<a name="workflow"></a>

1. Send your proposal as a PDF to: [pycon-organizers-apac@googlegroups.com](mailto:pycon-organizers-apac@googlegroups.com)
2. The Python APAC Committee (PAC for short) will initiate the 1st peer review of the proposals
   and will solicate comments from the APAC community.
3. After the deadline for the 1st peer review is over, there will be some time
   given to the proposers to review and amend their proposals based on the
   comments received from the 1st peer review.
4. After the deadline for amendements, the final proposal is sent again to [pycon-organizers-apac@googlegroups.com](mailto:pycon-organizers-apac@googlegroups.com) and
   the 2nd round of peer review and discussions among community members start.
5. After the 2nd peer review is over, we will vote for the host. To keep the
   voting managable and efficient, voting will only be done among the [APAC country representatives](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyConAPAC/Community)
6. The final decision for the selection of the on-site team and location will be
   announced by the PAC within a week after the voting deadline ends.

## What is PyCon APAC<a name="what"></a>

PyCon APAC is the Python conference for countries in the Asia Pacific and Australasia
region, including countries that do not organize their own PyCon conference. Unlike
PyCon US and EuroPython where the number of participants are more stable, the
number of participants at PyCon APAC varies depending on the hosting country. The
following is an estimate of past PyCon APAC's:

- 350+ participants in PyCon APAC (Singapore)
- 500+ participants in PyCon APAC (Tokyo, Japan)
- 700+ participants in PyCon APAC (Taipei, Taiwan)
- 1000+ participants in PyCon APAC (Seoul, South Korea)
- 200+ participants in PyCon APAC (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)
- 500+ participants in PyCon APAC (Manila, Philippines)

The main medium of communication in PyCon APAC is also dependent on the hosting
country. To meet the needs of an international audience however, and as host of
PyCon APAC, **the use of English (or translation to English) in the main and parallel
tracks is a requirement.** PyCon APAC will have:

- At least 2 conference days
- More than 2 parallel tracks, with at least 2 tracks in English

Given the nature of PyCon APAC, we are open to accepting proposals which can only
host fewer attendees, with a target of 100 attendees being the minimum.

# On-Site Team Requirements<a name="onsite"></a>

These are the requirements that an on-site team will sign-up to when submitting a
proposal. Changes to these requirements are possible, but they must be signed off by
the PAC before they can be put in place.

1. The conference will be financially and legally run by an entity registered at the
   hosting country and for which the on-site team is part of.
2. The on-site team must be geographically located in a country in the Asia Pacific
   and Australasia region.
3. The on-site team must be willing to actively coordinate with the PAC board and
   the other regional Python groups or Python workgroups where applicable, so
   that all parts of the PyCon APAC ecosystem can work together in a productive
   way. Of importance is the quality of the presentations which should be kept
   relevant, current and to a good/high level.
   1. This can be assisted with a panel of expert reviewers that ensures the
   quality of proposals submitted. The feedback of reviewers must be
   afforded to the proposers in order to assist improvements to their
   presentations where applicable.
   2. The on-site team is encouraged to invite the participation of PyCon
   APAC members as part of the panel of expert reviewers.
4. The on-site team must be composed of at least five (5) active members and the
   team, or a majority of its members thereof has previously organized at least
   one (1) PyCon conference before. Five members is the bare minimum for the
   on-site team to successfully handle the amount of work required to organize the
   conference.
   1. Please keep in mind that the team is required to grow significantly during
   the conference days and it is considered an advantage, if the on-site
   team can show that they already have a good number of volunteers to
   count on during the conference days.
5. The on-site team should provide details of suggested keynote speakers. At
   least 2 such speakers should be part of the plan.
6. The on-site team should ideally provide 2 available venue options, together with
   catering options for the venues. The size of the venue will depend on the size
   of past PyCon conferences in the host country plus between 10 - 20% more in
   view of PyCon APAC.
   1. The venue must provide breakout rooms for the number of expected
   attendees and the number of parallel tracks, with 2 English-based tracks
   being the minimum.
   2. Note: In past PyCon APAC's, on-site teams have sought and
   collaborated with institutions of higher learning (IHL's) as they can
   provide the venues required at no or low cost.
7. The conference must provide the following services to all attendees. Proposals
   will have to provide details about how these can be implemented at the
   proposed venues:
   1. Food and drinks for lunches and breaks on all conference days (and tutorials and sprints where applicable)
   2. Optionally, breakfast on all conference days (not necessarily on the tutorial and sprint days where applicable)
   3. WLAN service to access the Internet during the conference (and the tutorial and sprints if applicable)
   4. At least one social event, which can be a dinner, a show or some other form of entertainment, where food
      and drinks are served.  The main social event should ideally be available to all attendees, but may also be
      limited to a lower number of people, if the selected venue cannot serve as many participants.
   5. Audio/video facilities to support speakers and talk recordings.
8. The on-site team must provide a local expenses budget plan as part of the proposal.
   An example budget plan can be provided on request. The on-site team will provide details of
   how they will be funding for the conference in support of the expenses expected. In as far as possible,
   conference fees should be kept to a minimum to support the participation of attendees from the
   Asia Pacific / Australasia region. In support of the potential PyCon APAC host, requests for financial support can
   be made to the PAC to cover for specific items of the budget plan. **The finances associated with the running of
   the conference must be maintained in a manner that ensures transparency and proper financial governance.**
9. The on-site team must be able to provide supporting letters for visa applicants wanting to attend the conference.

# Proposal Structure<a name="structure"></a>

The proposal must cover all of the following points:

1. A proposal introduction which describes the motivation for the proposal.
2. A description of the on-site team, its members and history in the context of their
   local Python community.
3. Short biography of the key members and their previous experience in
   conference and events organizations.
4. Previous conference history of the on-site team (if any). Describe which
   conferences were run and provide some figures on their size (registrations,
   tracks, total income)
5. Assignment of key positions to on-site team members. Positions to be assigned
   (one member can be responsible for more than one of the following roles):
   1. Chairperson of the on-site team workgroup: usually also the conference chair and representative of the
      conference for that year
   2. Sponsor manager: on-site contact for all sponsor activities, responsible for local sponsors
   3. Venue manager: handling all contacts with the venue and caterer
   4. Logistics manager: handling all aspects of local logistics and customs
   5. Conference desk manager: responsible for the on-site help desk, on-site registrations, tickets, cash refunds,
      attendee support, etc.
6. List of all team members that will be present during the conference itself as
   volunteers (but not necessarily help before the conference begins), and/or sources from which people can be or
   will be acquired if needed (e.g., universities, other local associations, etc.). This list is indicative,
   as most of the volunteers helping during the conference are usually enrolled during the last months/weeks before
   the conference.
7. List of potential international and local sponsors. Note : Local sponsors help a
   lot in funding the conference. These are often smaller companies which will not
   move to new locations with the conference, so a local contact is highly
   beneficial in attracting these sponsors.
   1. The PAC can assist with contacts with international sponsors where possible
8. Proposed dates for PyCon APAC 2022.
9. Keynote speakers proposed.
10. Conference events. Describe which kind of (social) events you can propose for the conference and are able to
    provide support for.
11. Expected differences from previous PyCon APAC conferences. Please highlight what things would need to be changed
    in the way the conference is run on-site. Examples of things we would consider worthwhile to mention:
    1. "We can get additional support from the local government / city council"
    2. "We need to provide tickets to city locals at reduced prices"
    3. "We intend to serve meals in a different venue"
    4. "We have some extra space available for posters / sponsors"
    5. "We want to have our local Python conference run as satellite event" etc.

    7. Upstream internet connection (at least 100MB up and downstream)
    8. WLAN structure, service provider, their experience with similar events
       (The WLAN has to be able to handle at least the number of participant devices expected without problems)
    9. Available space for conference desk, sponsor booths, posters, social event, etc., planned locations of these on
       the floor plans
13. Accommodation. Describe the following sub-items:
    1. Available hotels/hostels near the conference venues, their distance from the conference venue, city centre,

    3. Travel costs from the previous mentioned travel hubs to the conference venue
    This information should indicate how easily the conference city and
    venue are accessible. It should also answer questions like: Are there
    convenient ways to get to the conference venue from airports/trains and
    bus stations and without having a car/taxi?
15. Visa. If attendees may require a visa to enter the country/city, please provide detailed information.
16. Proposed local budget.
    1. The budget should include all expected costs for the on-site support,
       including the venue costs, catering, on-site rental of equipment, costs for
       venue services and logistics, extras like public transport passes, etc.
       Optional budget positions should be indicated as such, to give more
       flexibility in comparing proposals.
    2. The budget must handle different scenarios related to different venues, where applicable, including fixed
       rooms costs, catering, services, etc. Please provide cost estimates for 200, 400, 600 and 800
       attendees (if possible with the venue).
    3. Please write to the PAC if you need help with setting up a budget plan.

# Proposal Format<a name="format"></a>

Some things to consider when sending the proposal document:

1. Please mark information that you consider confidential in the proposal, so that we can remove those parts
   from the version that will be published during the Call for Participation process.
2. The proposal itself should be sent as PDF, LibreOffice, Word document, shared as Google Docs document,
   or be a markdown file in the GitHub of this repository
3. When using third party content (e.g. pictures, graphics, special fonts), please add a section which includes the
   references for these elements of the proposal. We need to publish the proposals to the general public and
   thus adhere to copyright restrictions that may apply to the content.

## PyCon APAC - On the Longer Term<a name="longterm"></a>

A longer term goal of PyCon APAC is to integrate on-site teams to workgroups within a PyCon APAC framework wherein
tasks which do not need to be done by on-site team members can be implemented by distributed workgroups that can work remotely
and persist from location to location. This framework will help:

- reduce the loss of institutional knowledge
- reduce the amount of work and financial risk for on-site teams and
- encourage the wider APAC community to take part in the organization process
beside the on-site team

The PyCon APAC framework can take reference from models such as [those of EuroPython](https://www.europython-society.org/post/99718376575/europython-workgroups-call-for-volunteers).

## Additional considerations for PyCon APAC 2022<a name="addons"></a>

Below are additional considerations specific for 2022 and is to be
included in the proposal. Please include them in a separate section.
